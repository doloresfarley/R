## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(factoextra)
library(skimr)
testCarLoans  <- read.csv("~/Desktop/GMU School/MBA_739/Project Week5/FinalProject/DataSets/FinalTrainDataSource.csv")
# Construct a normalized dataset for everything other than the labels

testCarLoans1 <-  na.omit(testCarLoans)

testCarLoans1 <- testCarLoans1 %>%
   select(-Default) %>%
  scale()

#skim(framingham)
#summary(framingham)

testCarLoans <- testCarLoans[1:20000,]
set.seed(739)

km.testCarLoans =kmeans(testCarLoans,2,nstart=60)

# Visualize K-Means Clustering
fviz_cluster(km.testCarLoans, data = testCarLoans,
             palette = c("#1B9E77", "#D95F02"), 
             geom = "point",
             ellipse.type = "convex", 
             ggtheme = theme_bw()
             )

# Visualize K-Means Clustering
#fviz_cluster(km.framingham, data = framingham,
#             palette = c("#1B9E77", "#D95F02", "#7570B3", "#E7298A", "#66A61E"), 
#             geom = "point",
#             ellipse.type = "convex", 
#             ggtheme = theme_bw()
#              )

#We can also determine as to which clusters are closer to each other by looking at the distance between the clusters. As seen from the following code, Clusters 1 and 2 are more closer to each other, compared to other options. This can be visually ascertained from the previous command.
#try: distances between clusters
dist(km.testCarLoans$centers)


# Silhoutte Method
fviz_nbclust(testCarLoans, kmeans, method = "silhouette")+
 labs(subtitle = "Silhouette method")
```
